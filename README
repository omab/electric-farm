Electric sheep Graph utility


1. Description

farm is a Python program to show the relations between sheeps in a
Electric Sheep[1] sheep flock. It has options to output as a graph, filter
missing sheeps, graph paths, etc.


2. Requirements

    * An Electric sheep farm
    * pydot (http://code.google.com/p/pydot/)
    * python-graph (http://code.google.com/p/python-graph/)
    * libgv-python (http://www.graphviz.org/)


3. Output options available
    --graphs    Will create a file with the graph data, one file per
                flock.

    --color     Should the graph has colours? At the moment the color
                marks are for missing/existing files.
                Default to true

    --output-type   Graph data output format. farm uses graphviz[2]
                    to output it's graph data, supporting all its formats[3].
                    Defaults to svg files.

    --only-biggest  Only process the biggest path in a flock (useful for
                    playing big sheep sequences of).
        
    --print-paths   Outputs files in graph paths, useful to do:
                    mplayer -fs -really-quiet -fixed-vo $(./farm --print-paths)
                    to play sheep sequences.

    --full-play     Outputs all the paths as --print-paths, one after each other.
         
    --no-discard-loner  By default loner nodes are discarded from outputs.
    
    --no-discard-missing  By default nodes which files are missing are discarded
                          from outputs.
